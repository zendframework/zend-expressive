# zend-expressive: Middleware Microframework

zend-expressive is a PSR-7-based middleware microframework built on top of
[Stratigility](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-stratigility) and inspired
by [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com), [SlimPHP](http://www.slimframework.com),
and others.

Its goal is to provide an opinionated yet flexible approach to building
PSR-7-based middleware applications, using both programmatic approaches as well
as inversion of control.
