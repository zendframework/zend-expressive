# Content-Length Middleware

In some cases, you may want to include an explicit `Content-Length` response
header, without having to inject it manually. To facilitate this, we provide
`Zend\Expressive\Helper\ContentLengthMiddleware`.

This middleware delegates the request, and operates on the returned response. It
will return a new response with the `Content-Length` header injected under the
following conditions:

- No `Content-Length` header is already present AND
- the body size is non-null.

To register it in your application, you will need to do two things: register the
middleware with the container, and register the middleware in either your
application pipeline, or within routed middleware.

To add it to your container, add the following configuration:

```php
// In a `config/autoload/*.global.php` file, or a `ConfigProvider` class:

use Zend\Expressive\Helper;

return [
    'dependencies' => [
        'invokables' => [
            Helper\ContentLengthMiddleware::class => Helper\ContentLengthMiddleware::class,
        ],
    ],
];
```

To register it as pipeline middleware to execute on any request:

```php
// In `config/pipeline.php`:

use Zend\Expressive\Helper;

$app->pipe(Helper\ContentLengthMiddleware::class);
```

To register it within a routed middleware pipeline:

```php
// In `config/routes.php`:

use Zend\Expressive\Helper;

$app->get('/download/tarball', [
    Helper\ContentLengthMiddleware::class,
    Download\Tarball::class,
], 'download-tar');
```

## Caveats

One caveat to note is that if you use this middleware, but also write directly
to the output buffer (e.g., via a `var_dump`, or if `display_errors` is on and
an uncaught error or exception occurs), the output will not appear as you
expect. Generally in such situations, the contents of the output buffer will
appear, up to the specified `Content-Length` value. This can lead to truncted
error content and/or truncated application content.

We recommend that if you use this feature, you also use a PHP error and/or
exception handler that logs errors in order to prevent truncated output.
